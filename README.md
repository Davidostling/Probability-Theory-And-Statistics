# Probability-Theory-And-Statistics
A set of exams that I completed for a probability theory and statistics course at KTH, along with some other study materials. I believe these assignments provide a good sample of how I tackle concrete math problems in regards to probability theory and statistics _(descriptive statistics, point estimates and general methods of estimation; e.g. maximum likelihood estimation and the method of least squares, general confidence intervals; in particular confidence intervals for the mean and variance of normally distributed data, confidence intervals for proportions and for difference in means and proportions, statistical hypothesis testing, Chi2-tests of goodness of fit, homogeneity and independence, linear regression)_, feel free to have a look.
